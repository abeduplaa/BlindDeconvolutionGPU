# BlindDeconvolutionGPU

Speeding up blind deconvolution of a blurred image by using GPUs.

Provided with the matlab code from the paper [**Total Variation Blind Deconvolution: The Devil is in the Details**](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2014/papers/Perrone_Total_Variation_Blind_2014_CVPR_paper.pdf),
BlindDeconvolutionGPU is a sped up implementation of the proposed algorithm with NVIDIA GPUs. 

The proposed algorithm was developed by the Computer Vision Group at the University of Bern. The authors of the paper are [Daniele Perrone](perrone@iam.unibe.ch) and [Paolo Favaro](paolo.favaro@iam.unibe.ch).

The sped up algorithm has been implemented in C with CUDA libraries. This implementation is part of the practical course: GPU Programming in Computer Vision offered at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).
