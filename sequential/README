This package contains the implementation of the algorithm presented in the 
paper D. Perrone and P. Favaro: "Total Variation Blind Deconvolution:
The Devil is in the Details", IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and
Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014.

Quick start:
The scripts main_postcard.m and main_noisy.m run the algorithm on the
images shown in the paper (saved in the folder data/) and store the
results in the folder results/.

The script simplified_example.m shows a simplified version of the
algorithm that does not use the pyramid scheme, closely related to the
pseudo-code presented in the paper.

The script main_levin.m runs the algorithm on the dataset provided by
levin in:
http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~levina/papers/LevinEtalCVPR09Data.rar
Please notice that you need to download the dataset and put the *.mat
files in the folder data/levin/ in order to run the experiment. Also,
notice that to reproduce the results shown in the paper it is
necessary to download the non-blind algorithm from
http://groups.csail.mit.edu/graphics/CodedAperture/DeconvolutionCode.html
and uncomment line 54 of the script (fe = deconvSps(blurred,k,0.0068);).

Directories:
data: input blurry images.
results: results obtained by running the scripts in the main folder.
lib: unoptimized algorithm matlab code.

Code Description:
The main deblurring function si called deblur.m. See the function
documentation for a detailed description of the input parameters. 
The function blind.m is the main gradient descent algorithm described in
the paper (Algorithm 1).
